PRINCIPLE 1: RETURN VALUE OF EVERY SYSTEM CALL MUST BE CHECKED 
FOR POSSIBLE FAILURE. 

CATEGORIES OF LINUX SYSTEM CALL AS FAR AS ERROR HANDLING IS CONCERNED: 
    1) 1% system calls: NEVER FAIL. 
        eg. 

        getpid(); 
        getuid(); 

    2) 0.5 to 1 % system calls return void* 
        e.g. mmap() | shamat() 

    3) Rest of the system calls (98 to 99%) return an integer. 
        e.g. 
        open(), read(), write(), readv(), writev(), pread(), 
        pwrite(), lseek(), preadv(), pwritev(), close(), 
        dup(), dup2(), and MANY MORE 

PRINCIPLE: 
    If system call may fail (for whatever reason) and if it returns 
        1) void* then the system call returns NULL should it fail, 
        and returns non-NULL address should it succeed. 
        2) -1 should it fail and 0 should it succeed.
